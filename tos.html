    <h1 style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:24px;">Terms of Service</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;color:#ccc;margin-bottom:32px;">Last Edited On: October 28, 2025</p>
    <section style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      <h2 style="color:#fff;margin-bottom:10px;">1. General Acceptance and Definitions</h2>
  <p style="color:#ccc;"><strong>1.1. Acceptance.</strong> By using the Service or ordering Deliverables, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="privacy.html" style="text-decoration:underline;">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service.<br>
      <strong>1.2. Definitions.</strong><br>
      "Service" means the software, bots (e.g., NexaCore Bot), websites, features, and platform services.<br>
      "Deliverables" means any custom work created for you (websites, apps, scripts).<br>
      "SOW" means the binding Statement of Work or official quote detailing a specific custom project.</p>
    </section>
    <section style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      <h2 style="color:#fff;margin-bottom:10px;">2. User Conduct and Account Security</h2>
      <p style="color:#ccc;"><strong>2.1. Your Responsibility.</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, password, and any third-party authentication tokens. NexaCore is not liable for unauthorized activity on your account.<br>
      <strong>2.2. Prohibited Content.</strong> You agree not to upload, transmit, or share Content that is unlawful, defamatory, or infringes upon the IP rights of others.<br>
      <strong>2.3. User Termination.</strong> NexaCore reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate your access for any violation of these Terms or the law.</p>

    <section style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      <h2 style="color:#fff;margin-bottom:10px;">3. Custom Development and Project Management</h2>
      <p style="color:#ccc;"><strong>3.1. Upfront Payment.</strong> All custom services require a minimum payment of fifty percent (50%) of the total estimated cost to be paid upfront before any work begins.<br>
      <strong>3.2. Scope Control (No Changes).</strong> The Deliverables are strictly limited to the written specifications in the SOW. Once an order is placed and payment is processed, NexaCore does not accept changes to the SOW or project scope.<br>

      <strong>3.4. Automatic Acceptance.</strong> Failure to notify NexaCore of issues within the 36-hour Acceptance Period means the Deliverable is deemed formally accepted. The final payment is immediately due.<br>
      <strong>3.5. Late Payment Penalty.</strong> If the final invoice is not paid, NexaCore may charge a late fee (e.g., 1.5% per month) and reserves the right to withhold the Deliverables or suspend their functionality until the balance is paid.</p>
